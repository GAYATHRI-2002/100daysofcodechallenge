She was an actress, a model, a singer, and a sex symbol who captivated audiences with her beauty, charm, and talent. She starred in many successful films, such as Some Like It Hot, The Seven Year Itch, and The Misfits, and won several awards and accolades for her performances. She also founded her own production company and challenged the Hollywood system that tried to limit and exploit her. She was a complex and intelligent person who had a keen interest in literature, art, and politics. She was married three times, to James Dougherty, Joe DiMaggio, and Arthur Miller, and had many famous friends and admirers, such as John F. Kennedy, Marlon Brando, and Ella Fitzgerald. She struggled with personal issues, such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and infertility, and faced many hardships and scandals in her life. She died at the age of 36 from a barbiturate overdose, but her legacy lives on as one of the most enduring and influential figures in American culture</p></div></div>
