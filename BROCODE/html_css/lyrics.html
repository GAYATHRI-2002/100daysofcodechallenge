            When we're out in a crowd laughing loud
            And nobody knows why
            When we're lost at a club, getting drunk
            And you give me that smile

            Going home in the back of a car
            And your hand touches mine
            When we're done making love
            And you look up and give me those eyes

            'Cause all of the small things that you do
            Are what remind me why I fell for you
            And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
            I close my eyes and all I see is you
            And the small things you do

            When you call me at night while you're out
            Getting high with your friends (high with your friends)
            Every "hi", every "bye", every "I love you" you've ever said
            (You've ever said)

            'Cause all of the small things that you do
            Are what remind me why I fell for you
            And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
            I close my eyes and all I see is you
            And the small things you do
            When we're done making love
            And you look up and give me those eyes

            'Cause all of the small things that you do
            Are what remind me why I fell for you
            And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
            I close my eyes and all I see is you
            And the small things you do
            All the small things you do
